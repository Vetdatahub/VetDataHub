# Animal Condition
The "Animal Condition Classification Dataset" presents a unique and intricate data challenge in the realm of animal health assessment. Featuring a diverse array of animal species, ranging from birds to mammals, this dataset enables the development of predictive models to determine whether an animal's condition is dangerous or not based on five distinct symptoms. The dataset's diversity opens doors to creating a classification system that transcends taxonomic boundaries, making it particularly valuable for people interested in animal welfare and wildlife conservation. However, its manual collection process introduces potential sources of error, including spelling mistakes and variations in symptom representation. This necessitates meticulous data-cleaning efforts

# Animal Bites
In the United States, animal bites are often reported to law enforcement (such as animal control). The main concern with an animal bite is that the animal may be rabid. This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville, Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.

# Animal Information Dataset
This dataset encompasses a diverse array of attributes pertaining to various animal species worldwide. The dataset prominently includes fields such as Animal, Height (cm), Weight (kg), Color, Lifespan (years), Diet, Habitat, Predators, Average Speed (km/h), Countries Found, Conservation Status, Family, Gestation Period (days), Top Speed (km/h), Social Structure, and Offspring per Birth. These columns collectively offer a comprehensive understanding of animal characteristics, habitats, behaviors, and conservation statuses. Researchers and enthusiasts can utilize this dataset to analyze animal traits, study their habitats, explore dietary patterns, assess conservation needs, and conduct a wide range of ecological research and wildlife studies.

This dataset contains information about adopted animals from the Bloomington Animal Shelter. The migration from their former software, AnimalShelterNet, to the newer system Shelter Manager allowed us to preserve as much of this information as possible. It records data on intakedate, intakereason, istransfer, sheltercode, animalname and more. Each field contains unique information such as breed name, color and age of the animal which can be used to gain a better understanding of adoption trends in this area. Additionally it has fields on movement type/date and return/death records can help track changes in animal welfare technology over time.
